BPNet is a python package with a CLI to train and interpret base-resolution deep neural networks trained on functional genomics data such as ChIP-nexus or ChIP-seq. It addresses the problem of pinpointing the regulatory elements in the genome:

Specifically, it aims to answer the following questions:
- What are the sequence motifs?
- Where are they located in the genome?
- How do they interact?

For more information, see the BPNet manuscript:
